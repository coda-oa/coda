# Invoices
CODA's Invoices feature allows you track publication costs by modeling real world invoices your institution receives from publishers.

## Creating Invoices

An Invoice consists of an invoice head with invoice number, creditor, the payment status and a list of positions that are either linked to a publication or a free text position to represent other fees.
Using the drop down in the `Cost Type` column you can select the kind of cost applicable for a position from the [OpenCost schema](https://github.com/opencost-de/opencost/tree/main/doc) .

## What's missing?

Invoices can currently not be edited. This feature will be added in the near future.
