# Funding Requests

The Funding Requests feature allows your institution to monitor and review incoming requests.

## Overview

The overview page displays a list of Funding Requests and offers various filter options to customize the displayed requests.
A badge displays the current review status, while labels on the right can provide additional means to categorize the request.

```{admonition} Note
The filter options are still limited and will be expanded to allow filtering for arbitrary fields in the future!
